# hellowasm

    go get github.com/udhos/hellowasm
    cd ~/go/src/github.com/udhos/hellowasm
    ./build.sh
    hellowasm_server

/console/wasm_exec.html has also been split into two files:

* wasm_main.js
* index.html

Thus these entry points are equivalent:

* http://localhost:8080/console/wasm_exec.html
* http://localhost:8080/console/
